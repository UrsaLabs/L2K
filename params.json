{"name":"L2K","tagline":"Launchpad2Keyboard - Map your Novation Launchpad to keyboard presses.","body":"### Welcome to L2K GitHub Pages.\r\nThis project allows you to bind buttons on your Novation Launchpad to a keystroke on your keyboard. It was originally developed to allow control of Twitch streaming software (Xsplit, OBS) via a Novation Launchpad, but it can be used with any software subscribing to windows hotkey API.\r\n\r\n### Getting started\r\nTo get you started with L2K straight away we wrote a short [guide](https://github.com/UrsaLabs/L2K/wiki/Getting-Started) on our wiki. If you have any issues be sure to report them on our github issue tracking.\r\n\r\n### Download\r\nTo download the latest release, just check our github release page [here](https://github.com/UrsaLabs/L2K/releases).\r\n\r\n### FAQ\r\n\r\n- **What does the \"Hide\" button do? When I click it L2K just disappears and I can no longer find it!**\r\n  - It does exactly what it says :D It hides the app. When pressed, the application gets minimised into the system tray, where it can be unhidden or exited from .\r\n- **What does the \"Learn\" button do and why is it greyed out?**\r\n  - A lot of MIDI programs offer a learn function allowing the button on the hardware device to be pressed in order to activate a binding function. In the case of L2K this would mean that while the learn mode is active, you wouldn't have to click on the visual representation of the Launchpad button but rather press the actual button on your Launchpad to initiate binding. The button is there because this functionality will be added at some point but it's greyed out simply because it hasn't been implemented yet.\r\n\r\n### Contributors\r\nThis project was developed by Miso Zmiric (@mzmiric5) with some help from James Robertson (@rd3k). Special thanks to Ted John (@IntelOrca) for writing the Launchpad library used by this project.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
